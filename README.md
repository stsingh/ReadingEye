# ReadingEye
People that are visually impaired have difficulty understanding
text that is written or printed on paper. This limits the ability of
these individuals to have a comfortable experience with the
environment around them and can decrease their willingness to
leave their homes. The goal of this project was to develop an aid
for people that are visually impaired to help them read text from
documents in a cost-effective, and hands-free manner.
